# Proposed Formula to calculate reputaion in profile section
We will calculate Reputation as follows:

Books Uploaded: 50 points each
Notes Shared: 20 points each
Likes/Upvotes Received: 10 points each
Current Mock Data Example:

Books: 12 * 50 = 600
Notes: 45 * 20 = 900
Total Base: 1500 (This is already higher than the current 1250 hardcoded value, so we'll adjust the mock data or the formula to make sense).
Revised Mock Data:

We will add likesReceived field to the mock user object (e.g., 125 likes).
Total = (12 * 50) + (45 * 20) + (125 * 10) = 600 + 900 + 1250 = 2750.
